# AWS SageMaker

## What is AWS SageMaker?

- We are going to train and deploy our models for inference on AWS SageMaker.
- SageMaker will be exposing the AI models via exposing the ML models via an API allowing for inference requests to be made.
- SageMaker will be handling the scaling of the inference requests.
- SageMakers consists of pre-trained models as well which are best suited for the task

- AWS SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker reduces the time it takes to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
- We are going to use AWS SageMaker to host and deploy our machine learning models. SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly.
- SageMaker reduces the time it takes to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
- SageMaker is integrated with Jupyter notebooks, so you can easily build, train, and deploy models without leaving your notebook.
- SageMaker also provides built-in algorithms for common machine learning tasks, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.
- SageMaker also provides tools for data preparation, model evaluation, and model deployment.
- SageMaker also provides tools for model monitoring and model retraining.
- SageMaker also provides tools for model explainability and model interpretability.
- SageMaker also provides tools for model fairness and model bias.
- SageMaker also provides tools for model privacy and model security.

## How to use AWS SageMaker?

### Step 1: Create a SageMaker Notebook Instance

- Go to the SageMaker console and click on "Notebook instances" in the left-hand menu.
- Click on "Create notebook instance".
- Choose a name for your notebook instance.
- Choose an instance type. For this example, we'll use a ml.t2.medium instance.
- Choose a IAM role. For this example, we'll use the default execution role.
- Click on "Create notebook instance".
- Wait for the notebook instance to be created. This may take a few minutes.
- Once the notebook instance is created, click on "Open Jupyter" to open the Jupyter notebook interface.

## AI Models

- We are going to use TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Time Series Analysis possibly

- RL Agents can be trained on AWS SageMaker.
- RL Agents can be trained on AWS SageMaker using the RL Toolkit. Expose RL-powered decision-making through Cloud Run APIs
