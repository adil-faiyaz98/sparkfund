## Security Testing Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - OSINT gathering
   - Service enumeration
   - Subdomain enumeration
   - Technology stack identification

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Automated scanning
   - Manual testing
   - Code review
   - Configuration review

3. **Exploitation**
   - Proof of concept development
   - Impact assessment
   - Risk evaluation

4. **Reporting**
   - Vulnerability documentation
   - Remediation recommendations
   - Risk scoring
   - Compliance mapping

## Continuous Security Testing

Security tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency scanning
   - Secret scanning

2. **CI Pipeline**
   - Unit tests with security focus
   - Integration tests with security scenarios
   - Container scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

3. **CD Pipeline**
   - Infrastructure as Code security
   - Deployment security
   - Runtime security monitoring

4. **Post-deployment**
   - Continuous security monitoring
   - Automated security testing
   - Compliance checking
   - Incident response testing
