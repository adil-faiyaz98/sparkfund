# Helm Charts for Money Pulse

## Helm Chart Overview

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications. Helm Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

## Money Pulse Helm Chart Structure

The Money Pulse Helm Chart is structured to deploy the Money Pulse application along with its dependencies. Here is an overview of the key components:

## Chart.yaml

This file contains metadata about the chart, including its name, version, and dependencies. Here is an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: money-pulse
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes
```

### Helm Charts and Kubernetes. What is the relationship?

- Helm Charts are packages that define, configure, and deploy Kubernetes applications. They provide a way to manage complex Kubernetes deployments in a more efficient and reusable manner.
- Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
- Helm Charts and Kubernetes are complementary technologies. Helm Charts use Kubernetes manifests to define the desired state of your application, and Kubernetes ensures that the actual state matches the desired state.
- Helm Charts can be used to deploy applications on any Kubernetes cluster, making them a powerful tool for managing Kubernetes applications at scale.

### Helm Charts vs Terraform vs Ansible ? What is the difference ?

- Helm Charts manage Kubernetes applications, providing a way to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes resources. It is specifically designed for Kubernetes.
- Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that can manage a wide range of infrastructure providers, including Kubernetes. It is more general-purpose and can be used to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.
- Ansible is an automation tool that can manage configuration, deployment, and orchestration of applications. It is agentless and can be used to manage both infrastructure and applications.

- **Helm Charts**: Kubernetes-specific, focuses on application deployment and management.
- **Terraform**: General-purpose IaC tool, can manage infrastructure across multiple providers, including Kubernetes.
- **Ansible**: Automation tool, can manage both infrastructure and applications, agentless.

### Can all three of these tools be used together ? i.e Helm Charts, Terraform and Ansible ?

- Yes, all three tools can be used together to manage Kubernetes applications and infrastructure. Here's how they can complement each other:
- **Terraform**: Use Terraform to manage the underlying infrastructure, such as creating Kubernetes clusters, VPCs, and subnets.
- **Ansible**: Use Ansible to manage configuration and orchestration of the infrastructure, such as setting up security groups, IAM roles, and other configuration tasks.
- **Helm Charts**: Use Helm Charts to deploy and manage Kubernetes applications on the infrastructure created by Terraform and configured by Ansible.
