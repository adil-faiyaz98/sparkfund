# Monitoring and Observability / Alerting

## Prometheus - Why do we use it?

- Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- It is designed for reliability and scalability.
- It is used to monitor and alert on metrics.
- It is used to visualize metrics.
- It is used to alert on metrics.
- It is used to record metrics.
- It is used to query metrics.
- It is used to store metrics.
- It is used to scrape metrics.
- It is used to push metrics.
- It is used to pull metrics.
- It is used to aggregate metrics.
- It is used to filter metrics.
- It is used to transform metrics.
- It is used to alert on metrics.

## Grafana - Why do we use it?

- Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
- It is used to visualize metrics.
- It is used to create dashboards.
- It is used to create alerts.
- It is used to create reports.
- It is able to visualize the data that was scraped by prometheus

## ELK Stack - Why do we use it?

- ELK Stack is an open-source platform for searching, analyzing, and visualizing log data in real-time.
- It is used to collect logs.
- It is used to index logs.
- It is used to search logs.
- It is used to analyze logs.
- It is used to visualize logs.
- It is used to alert on logs.
- It is used to monitor logs.
- It is used to store logs.
- It is used to aggregate logs.
- It is used to filter logs.
- It is used to transform logs.

## Open Telemetry - Why do we use it?

- OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.
- It is used to instrument applications.
- It is used to generate telemetry data.
- It is used to collect telemetry data.
- It is used to export telemetry data.
- It is used to analyze telemetry data.
- It is used to visualize telemetry data.
- It is used to alert on telemetry data.
- It is used to monitor telemetry data.
- It is used to store telemetry data.
- It is used to aggregate telemetry data.
- It is used to filter telemetry data.
- It is used to transform telemetry data.
- It is used to correlate telemetry data.
- It is used to trace telemetry

## So, amongst the above, the best tools to monitor and observe a Model once it has been deployed in production are:

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- ELK Stack
- Open Telemetry
- These tools are used to monitor and observe the performance and behavior of the model in production.
- They are used to alert on metrics, logs, and telemetry data.
- They are used to visualize the data.
- They are used to create dashboards.
- They are used to create alerts.
- They are used to create reports.
- They are used to monitor the model.
- They are used to observe the model.
- They are used to analyze the model.
- They are used to correlate the data.
- They are used to trace the data.
