- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

SparkFund includes comprehensive monitoring and observability:

### Prometheus

Prometheus collects metrics from all services. Access the Prometheus UI at http://localhost:9090.

### Grafana

Grafana provides visualization of metrics with pre-configured dashboards. Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (username: admin, password: admin).

### Jaeger

Jaeger provides distributed tracing for request flows. Access the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686.

### Logging

All services use structured logging with consistent formats. Logs can be viewed using:

```bash
# View logs for all services
docker-compose logs

# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs [service-name]
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check if all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
2. View logs for a specific service: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
3. Restart a specific service: `docker-compose restart [service-name]`
4. Restart all services: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

### Common Issues

- **Service Unavailable**: Check if the service container is running and healthy
- **Database Connection Issues**: Check if PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify the JWT token is valid and not expired
- **API Gateway Routing Issues**: Check the Nginx configuration in the API Gateway service
- **Kubernetes Deployment Issues**: Check pod status and events with `kubectl describe pod`
- **Terraform Errors**: Check the Terraform state and logs for detailed error messages
