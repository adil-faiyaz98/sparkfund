## AI Capabilities

SparkFund integrates AI capabilities across its services as a **Proof of Concept (POC)**. The core microservices functionality is implemented, but the AI features are primarily **simulations** demonstrating how machine learning could enhance financial services.

### KYC Service AI (POC Implementation)

- **Document Verification**: Analysis of identity documents for authenticity and data extraction

  - _Integration Pattern_: API forwarding to an external AI service
  - _Implementation Status_: **API Forwarding with Mock Fallbacks** - Most endpoints call an external AI service, with local mock responses as fallbacks
  - _Production Readiness_: **Low** - Requires actual AI service with trained models for document verification

- **Facial Recognition**: Face matching between selfie and ID document

  - _Integration Pattern_: External API call to dedicated AI service
  - _Implementation Status_: **API Integration** - Requests forwarded to external service endpoint `/api/v1/face/match-base64`
  - _Production Readiness_: **Low** - Dependent on external service with actual face recognition models

- **Risk Analysis**: Assessment of customer risk profile

  - _Integration Pattern_: External API call to dedicated AI service
  - _Implementation Status_: **API Integration** - Requests forwarded to external service endpoint `/api/v1/risk/analyze`
  - _Production Readiness_: **Low** - Dependent on external service with actual risk assessment models

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of suspicious patterns in verification requests
  - _Integration Pattern_: External API call to dedicated AI service
  - _Implementation Status_: **API Integration** - Requests forwarded to external service endpoint `/api/v1/anomaly/detect`
  - _Production Readiness_: **Low** - Dependent on external service with actual anomaly detection models

### Investment Service AI (POC Implementation)

- **Recommendation System**: Personalized investment recommendations based on user profile and market conditions

  - _Models_: Interfaces defined for collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation systems
  - _Implementation Status_: **Simulation** - API endpoints return realistic sample responses that mimic model predictions
  - _Production Readiness_: **Low** - Would require real model training, evaluation, and deployment

- **Natural Language Processing**: Analysis of market news for investment signals

  - _Models_: References to BERT-based sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic modeling
  - _Implementation Status_: **Placeholder** - Text processing pipeline defined but not connected to actual models
  - _For use in Actual projects\*\*: - integrate with actual NLP models for more accurate analysis_

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Price prediction and market movement analysis

  - _Models_: Interfaces for ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet models
  - _Implementation Status_: **Simulation** - Returns sample forecasts based on historical patterns
  - _For use in Actual projects\*\*: - integrate with actual time series forecasting models for more accurate predictions_

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Portfolio optimization and investment strategy learning

  - _Models_: Scaffold code for Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
  - _Implementation Status_: **Conceptual** - Framework defined but lacks actual RL implementation
  - _For use in Actual projects\*\*: - integrate with actual RL algorithms for more sophisticated investment strategies_

- **Anomaly Detection**: Fraud detection and security monitoring
  - _Models_: References to Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoder-based anomaly detection
  - _Implementation Status_: **Simulation** - Provides mock anomaly scores without real detection
  - _For use in Actual projects\*\*: - integrate with actual anomaly detection models for enhanced security_

### AI Service (Central AI Capabilities)

- **Document Analysis**: Extract information from documents using computer vision and NLP

  - _Models_: CRAFT for text detection, BERT for information extraction
  - _Implementation_: End-to-end document processing pipeline
  - _Endpoints_: `/api/v1/document/analyze`

- **Image Classification**: Classify images for various purposes

  - _Models_: EfficientNet, ResNet for image classification
  - _Implementation_: Image processing and classification endpoints
  - _Endpoints_: `/api/v1/image/classify`

- **Text Analysis**: Sentiment analysis, entity extraction, and text classification
  - _Models_: DistilBERT for sentiment analysis, SpaCy for NER
  - _Implementation_: Text processing endpoints with multiple analysis options
  - _Endpoints_: `/api/v1/text/analyze`

### POC Implementation Notes

The AI capabilities are implemented as a proof of concept with the following characteristics:

1. **API Endpoints**: All AI endpoints are fully defined and documented in Swagger
2. **Integration Patterns**:
   - KYC Service uses API forwarding to an external AI service
   - Investment Service uses direct simulation within the service
3. **Sample Responses**: Many endpoints return realistic sample responses based on the expected model output
4. **Service Configuration**: Comprehensive configuration for AI service integration is defined but points to placeholder services
5. **Demonstration Ready**: The system demonstrates the potential of AI in financial services
6. **Production Path**: Would require significant additional work to implement or integrate with real AI models

### Running Tests

- Not going to run tests for now. But, some really important security related tests are in api-gateway. As for the others, I would recommend the builders for in-depth testing.

## Monitoring and Observability

SparkFund includes comprehensive monitoring and observability:

### Prometheus

Prometheus collects metrics from all services. Access the Prometheus UI at http://localhost:9090.

### Grafana

Grafana provides visualization of metrics with pre-configured dashboards. Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (username: admin, password: admin).

### Jaeger

Jaeger provides distributed tracing for request flows. Access the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686.

### Logging

All services use structured logging with consistent formats. Logs can be viewed using:

```bash
# View logs for all services
docker-compose logs

# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs [service-name]
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

## ChatGPT for Help. Otherwise:

1. Check if all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
2. View logs for a specific service: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
3. Restart a specific service: `docker-compose restart [service-name]`
4. Restart all services: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

### Common Issues

- **Service Unavailable**: Check if the service container is running and healthy
- **Database Connection Issues**: Check if PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify the JWT token is valid and not expired
- **API Gateway Routing Issues**: Check the Nginx configuration in the API Gateway service
- **Kubernetes Deployment Issues**: Check pod status and events with `kubectl describe pod`
- **Terraform Errors**: Check the Terraform state and logs for detailed error messages
