## üö¢ Deployment

### Local Deployment

Local deployment is handled through Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes deployment configurations are available in the `deploy/k8s` directory.

```bash
# Apply Kubernetes configurations
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes with Helm charts and GitOps workflows. Configurations are available in the `deploy` directory.

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check if all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
2. View logs for a specific service: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
3. Restart a specific service: `docker-compose restart [service-name]`
4. Restart all services: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

### Common Issues

- **Service Unavailable**: Check if the service container is running and healthy
- **Database Connection Issues**: Check if PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify the JWT token is valid and not expired
- **API Gateway Routing Issues**: Check the Nginx configuration in the API Gateway service
